# Web OPL3 Player

This project allows you to play music on OPL3 sound chips via the Web Serial API. It's a Javascript + Webassembly implementation of the RetroWavePlayer and does not rely on emulation, so it only works with a physical device. 

It's  been tested on the [RetroWave OPL3 Express (v2)](https://shop.sudomaker.com/products/retrowave-opl3-express), but should generally work with any OPL3 chip connected via serial port.
